\textcolor{red}{In this Chapter, you present in more concrete terms the method(s) you are going to apply. And as always in research, it is good to demonstrate awareness of the weaknesses or limitations of the method you use.

Transparency should be the guideline: make it possible for your readers to follow, or even repeat, your analysis!}
