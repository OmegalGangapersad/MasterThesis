\textcolor{black}{{\bf Abstract} 
The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment scorecard provides South African firms with specific targets to comply to the empowerment of Black people. This study adds to scientific body by investigating the long term relationship between B-BBEE policy and  firm performance. 
The theoretical framework suggests that the general long term relationship between B-BBEE policy and firm performance should be negative. Specifically, this negative relationship should become more negative and the relationship should differ across sectors. 
This study test the relationship with share price return on 1 to 5 years time horizons as the dependent variable and B-BBEE ranks based on the Empowerdex top 100 as the treatment variable spanning the maximum time period from 2004 to 2018. 
The empirical results of this study confirms the findings from the theoretical framework. The long term relationship is found significantly negative on 2,3,4 years time horizon. B-BBEE policy amendments through time causes the negative relationship to be more pronounced. This study hints that B-BBEE compliance market access benefits in practise acts as a tax on firms to continue to do business with government entities.
The findings of this study state that the incentives of firms to comply to B-BBEE are not sufficiently aligned with the purpose of B-BBEE.
