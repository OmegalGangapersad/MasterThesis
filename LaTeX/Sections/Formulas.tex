\begin{equation}
AR_i_t=R_i_t - E(R_i_t|X_i_t)
\end{equation}
$AR_i_t$ is the abnormal return for observation $i$ on date $t$, $R_i_t$ is the actual return for observation $i$ on date $t$ and $E(R_i_t|X_i_t)$ = expected return on for observation $i$ date $t$ given conditioning return model $X$ for observation $i$ date $t$.

\begin{equation}
Y_i_t=\alpha_i_t + \beta X_i_t^{,} + \beta \pi_i_t^{,} + \epsilon_i_t
\end{equation}
$Y_i_t$ is the firm performance variable for observation $i$ at time $t$,
$\alpha_i_t$ is the alpha or excess return for observation $i$ at time $t$, $X_i_t^{,}$ is the vector of B-BBEE scores as treatment variable for observation $i$ at time $t$, $\pi_i_t^{,}$ is the vector of control variables for observation $i$ at time $t$ and $\epsilon_i_t$ is the error term for observation $i$ at time $t$.
The coefficient of interest here is $\beta$, which is tested for significance using a t-test.

\begin{equation}
E(R_i_t) - R_f_t = \beta _i_M[E(R_i_t) - R_f_t] + \beta_i_s E(SMB_t) + \beta_i_h E(HML_t)
\end{equation}
where $E(R_i_t) - R_f_t$
is the expected excess share price return for observation $i$ at time t over the risk free return at time $t$,
$\beta _i_M[E(R_i_t) - R_f_t]$ is the (beta) coefficient of observation $i$ for the market risk premium at time $t$ over the risk free return at time $t$, $\beta_i_s E(SMB_t)$ is the (beta) coefficient of observation $i$  for the premium of size at time $t$ and
$\beta_i_h E(HML_t)$ is the (beta) coefficient of observation $i$  for the premium of value at time $t$.
