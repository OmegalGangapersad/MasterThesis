	abstract = {‘Black Economic Empowerment’ (BEE) has been a major policy thrust of the democratic governments in South Africa since 1994 in attempting to redress the effects of apartheid. In this article, we explore the historical precedents to BEE in South Africa, review the different steps taken in promoting it, and assess some of its outcomes to date. We argue that BEE can take only limited forms because of the economic policy constraints in which it has been incorporated. Moreover, these forms have an increasingly managerial logic that further restricts what can be achieved. Short of a major shift in conceptions of — and policy for — BEE, meaningful ‘empowerment’ is unlikely to take place.},

	abstract = {Government introduced the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Act, No. 53
of 2003 and the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Codes of Good Practice
(‘the Codes’) in 2007 to address the economic inequalities in South Africa by
incentivising companies to include black people in economic activities. These
incentives relate to implementation of preferential procurement, which is meant to
favour companies that are BEE-compliant.
Based on the literature and government’s intention with BEE policies, an assumption
developed that companies with greater BEE compliance, which is measured through
a BEE scorecard as per the Codes, would perform better in terms of market share
through their revenue and in terms of profits. The main objective of this study was to
carry out an in-depth analysis of the relationship between BEE scores and revenue
growth and profitability of JSE-listed companies. This was done to determine whether
the efforts by government of incentivising companies to be more BEE compliant are
effective.
This study was conducted as a two-part model consisting of regression analysis and ttest to determine whether there is a relationship between BEE scores and revenue and
profitability. The regression analysis focused on the top 100 most black-empowered
companies. The t-test was a comparison of two data sets, which consisted of
companies in the top 100 most black-empowered companies and those that do no fall
among the top 100 most black-empowered companies.
The results showed that, at the time of this research, there were no significant
relationships between BEE scores and revenue and profitability. The analysis of the
research findings collectively demonstrated that for both the tests (regression and ttest), the relationship between revenue and profitability could not be established.
Hence, the results postulate that BEE compliance does not produce the desired results
for the companies, which can be translated into better profitability and market share.},

	abstract = {Black business community participated in SA economy for survival purposes rather than for prosperity and contribution to its development at large. The rest of the black population formed a labour pool as a race-based lumpenproletariat. It is only in 1993 that BEE was introduced to dramatically reform the economy by including all races.
The aim of the study was to determine BEE owned company success factors given the criticism and challenges faced. A qualitative, exploratory study was undertaken to gain in-depth knowledge from thirteen BEE experts through semi-structured interviews. The respondents were selected by way of purposive and snowball sampling and the highest combined total NAV of the BEE owned companies studied is over R92 Billion.
The study found that at a macro-economic level for economic empowerment to succeed, political, psychological, economic and social powers need to be present. At a micro-economic level access to funding, skills and value creation is instrumental in ensuring BEE ownership succeeded. White corporates also had to be involved to de-racialise the economy. To this effect a model was developed which maps out a blueprint for BEE owned company success. It is the recommendation of the study that BEE-owned companies should continuously innovate to fuel growth},

	abstract = {The black economic empowerment (BEE) score consists of seven elements, namely ownership, management control, employment equity, skills development, preferential procurement, enterprise development and socio-economic development. The purpose of this study is to establish whether an association exists between an entity's BEE elements and its share returns in the short term. Based on prior literature, it appears that the market reacts positively to an announcement of a BEE deal, although the literature also indicates that an entity's BEE score, which includes all seven elements of the BEE score, bears a negative relationship to its share returns. Therefore the association between the various BEE elements and share returns needs to be investigated. The study uses a multivariate regression analysis that controls for factors influencing share returns. The study includes the BEE element data as obtained from the survey of the top empowerment companies carried out by Empowerdex/Financial Mail for the period 2005 to 2011. The results of this study indicate that a significant positive association exists between the management control element of the BEE score and the entity's share returns. Furthermore, a significant negative association exists between the ownership and preferential procurement elements of an entity and its share returns. This study contributes to the literature on BEE in the accounting and finance field in South Africa as well as enhances the understanding and effect of BEE compliance through implementation of the generic scorecard as required by the 2007 codes of good practice. The results of this study would be of interest to government policy analysts, investors and managers.},

The boards of directors of High Sustainability companies are more likely to be formally responsible for sustainability and top executive compensation incentives are more likely to be a function of sustainability metrics. High Sustainability companies are more likely to have established processes for stakeholder engagement, to be more long-term oriented, and to exhibit higher measurement and disclosure of nonfinancial information. Finally, High Sustainability companies significantly outperform their counterparts over the long-term, both in terms of stock market and accounting performance.},

Considerable emphasis is placed on the politics of the ANC and to a lesser extent the general situation of the South African economy rather than by dissecting economic debates alone. MERG was a relatively lone substantial voice calling for real structural and institutional changes in the economy, ultimately rejected by the ANC at the behest of business. Two decades after the end of apartheid, it has become a hallmark of liberal criticism of the government to denounce it as following the worked-out agenda of a radical agenda underlying the anti-apartheid rhetoric while the African National Congress clothes itself in the liberation language of the Freedom Charter and sometimes even the supposed first-stage National Democratic Revolution that will precede socialism reflecting the discourse of the South African Communist Party. The following discussion aims to clarify what actually happened in terms of macro-economic policy debates in the transitional years 1990–94 and the consequences.},

	abstract = {Regulation has become a central aspect of contemporary governance as a result of public management reforms over recent decades. Yet, for all its ubiquity, the ideas of regulation have become increasingly contested. Key failures in the regulation of areas such as financial markets, nuclear power and food safety have revealed limitations in strategies which were once praised as offering superior problem-solving solutions.
This major new text introduces the issues which affect the design and operation of regulatory regimes, and assesses the different regulatory strategies which can be used to deal with real-world challenges. In doing so, it examines the most important areas in regulatory policy and reform, including rule-making and enforcement, better regulation, infrastructure regulation, international regulation and risk regulation. Throughout the book, Martin Lodge and Kai Wegrich discuss a range of hypothetical and real-world examples to illustrate key issues, options and trade-offs, and to encourage readers to think critically and creatively about the regulatory options which are available. Drawing on the most up-to-date research, this text provides a clear and useful toolkit for thinking analytically about regulation.},

	abstract = {In current marketplaces, Corporate Social Responsibility is a new expectation to be fulfilled by all sort of organizations in order to build a positive reputation and send a signal to their stakeholders. In this respect, analysis of the consequences of perceived firms’ responsibility on consumer behavior has been a common topic in recent marketing literature. Major evidences indicate a positive link between involvement in social and environmental causes and consumer goodwill towards firms and brands. In the context of these results, this paper analyzes the consideration of responsibility criteria over the different stages of the consumer decision-making process in the cosmetics sector. Particularly, a self-administered questionnaire was conducted with a representative sample of consumers in Spain. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to identify relevant dimensions of consumer decision-making based on responsibility criteria and their incidence on men and women separately and on different age ranges. In general, findings support a moderate impact of perceived business responsibility over the consumer decision-making process, while some discrepancies can be observed between individuals within gender and different age groups. In this sense, young consumers were found to display a lower consideration of responsibility criteria in their purchase decisions whereas the 51–75 age group pointed to an overall lack of knowledge about them. Additionally, women, in contrast to men, tend to be more responsibility-conscious when acquiring cosmetics. Lastly, a final discussion is carried out gathering some interest considerations as direct reflection of results obtained and further lines of future research are indicated.},

Government laws have sought to involve corporations in promoting social cohesion and in addressing problems of historical exclusion of Black communities from the mainstream economy. This objective of transformation within the economy culminated in the release of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act in 2003. The Department of Trade and Industry finalized the Codes of Good Practice on February 9, 2007, to clarify and ensure consistency in the implementation of socially responsible behavior in one area, empowerment of historically disadvantaged Black people (other areas of CSR do not display this consistently) within organizations across industry sectors. In this article, the authors discuss the key principles of this legislation, approaches to monitoring and measuring Codes of Good Practice implementation, and their implications for social-change initiatives in local and multinational enterprises that operate in South Africa.},

BEE was introduced by the current ANC government in a bid to overcome the economic legacy of apartheid and to broaden participation in the economy, especially by those perceived to have been previously excluded or denied access. The Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) has been tasked with overseeing the implementation of BEE, and for this purpose has created a special BEE unit to regulate compliance and administer BEE scorecards. In an empirical survey, conducted in March / April of 2010 among the top local South African businesses ranging from small, medium to large multinational companies, the perceptions, thoughts and anticipations of 500 individual managers on the impact of BEE on ten selected dimensions of business performance were sought. Alarmingly, most of the respondents disagreed with the notion that BEE compliance would improve the performance of the companies they worked for, specifically with regard to overall and international competitiveness; service excellence and client satisfaction; quality; productivity; entrepreneurial spirit and innovation; production performance; human development; staff morale, business ethics and transparency; sales and access to markets; and financial performance. These sentiments were expressed despite the fact that the majority of respondents indicated that they as individuals could stand to benefit if the companies they were employed in became BEE-compliant.},

It is designed to be a "first port of call" for people wishing to study efficiency and productivity analysis. The book provides an accessible introduction to the four principal methods involved: econometric estimation of average response models; index numbers; data envelopment analysis (DEA); and stochastic firontier analysis (SFA). For each method, we provide a detailed introduction to the basic concepts, give some simple numerical examples, discuss some of the more important extensions to the basic methods, and provide references for further reading. In addition, we provide a number of detailed empirical applications using real-world data. The book can be used as a textbook or as a reference text. As a textbook, it probably contains too much material to cover in a single semester, so most instructors will want to design a course around a subset of chapters. For example, Chapter 2 is devoted to a review of production economics and could probably be skipped in a course for graduate economics majors. However, it should prove useful to undergraduate students and those doing a major in another field, such as business management or health studies.},

The question has often been asked whether the announcement of BEE transactions by listed companies increases shareholder wealth.

The results indicate a positive relation between BEE transaction announcements and shareholder wealth creation, but only during the last part of the period covered by the study.},

Before their breakthrough, there were no asset pricing models built from first principles about the nature of tastes and investment opportunities and with clear testable predictions about risk and return. Four decades later, the CAPM is still widely used in applications, such as estimating the cost of equity capital for firms and evaluating the performance of managed portfolios. And it is the centerpiece, indeed often the only asset pricing model taught in MBA level investment courses.},

Many suggested solutions for market failure, such as tax-subsidy schemes, property rights assignments, and special pricing arrangements, are simply devices for the creation of more markets. This remedy can be beneﬁcial but, if the addition of markets creates either nonconvexities or thin participation, then adding markets will simply lead to market failure from monopolistic behaviour. Examples are natural monopolies and informational monopolies. To achieve a more efﬁcient allocation of resources in the presence of such fundamental failures one must explore non-market alternatives.},
