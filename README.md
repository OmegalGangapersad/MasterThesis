# Purpose of this repository
This repository contains the code base upon which my master thesis empirical results were generated. This can be found in the folder EmpiricalAnalysis. The folder LaTeX contains the LaTeX project used to generate the thesis. I added the repository to github to increase transparancy and replicatability of my findings. 

# Requirements to run Empirical Analysis
